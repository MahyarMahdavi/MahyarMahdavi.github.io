        <h3>About me </h3>
            <p>Thanks for making it to my personal website 😊 — it already means a lot to me.</p>
            <p>
                🎓 I am currently in my 4th year of Computer Science at Toronto Metropolitan University. One of the reasons I got into this field was because I had no clue about anything in tech, and that feeling of not knowing anything motivated me to get into it, learn, and develop day by day.
            </p>
            <p> 🏙️ At this time, I am working my co-op at the City of Toronto as an IT Trainee. This role was my first co-op, and it has been such a great experience for me so far.</p>
            <p>
                📊 When I started my role, I was assigned to go through large amounts of Excel data that was derived from ServiceNow, a platform used to manage IT services, requests, and incidents. I quickly realized that doing this process repeatedly could take a lot of time and consume a significant amount of human energy.
            </p>
            <p>⚙️ As a result, I started implementing a system using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to allow this process to be completed in only a few seconds.</p>
            <p>
                🚀 Once the time-consuming and tiring process of going through large chunks of data was reduced to just a couple of clicks, I began analyzing the results. I then wrote technical articles to help users troubleshoot their issues. This allowed City of Toronto users to resolve their IT issues much faster and more easily on their own.
            </p>
